# Mobile-App
## Fall 2017 Park University:  Mobile App Project in progress
At the current stage of the mobile development, I am going through basic steps of putting the app together
using **PHP, HTML, and JQueryMobile, and SQL**. 

## Cool Things About the App
* First of all,the following application is dynamic, meaning it needs to access a server in order to function properly.
* On the background, application successfully cooperates with the database to retreive and enter the data. 
* Using the app one can take photos without leaving it, and upload them after. 
* Application has a capability of showing current location to the user via Google Maps.

Happy Employee App, is supposed to be used by the company Antiques Inc. to simplify the duties for its employees and make the work
more efficient.Using the application,the employee can view his/her daily tasks.
